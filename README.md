accidents.py contains code from each contributors (AaronChen589-RitaChen2-Tiffanyy-C)

source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents (2016-2021)


## Significance/Goal
-Determine relationship among factors and how they affect the number of car crashes, severity (scale from 1- 4 on its impact on traffic), and distance (length of the road extent affected)
-Create multiple predictive models for car crashes based on significant factors
-Create visualizations of these models through graphs and charts


## Conclusions
Many accidents occurred....
-In Florida and California both during the day and night (in general, majority of accidents were during the day)
-From noon to 6 PM and between October and December
-During “good weather” with high visibility (10 miles)
-Between  40℉  and 80℉
-With a severity of 2 (from a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 is the least impactful and 4 is the most)


##Remarks
-The classification data could be susceptible to overfitting/bias when classifying the expected severity
-There also could’ve been unequal sampling from all the states in the US (ex: a few hundred samples from in some states and tens of thousands of samples from other states)
-Some of the descriptions of our data were vague such as the scale of severity being  unclear, 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay) but short/long isn’t measurable
-Variables like population size, traffic/road density, rush hours, holidays, state proximity, etc. are not included
