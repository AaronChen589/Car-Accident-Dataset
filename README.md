## Significance/Goal
-Determine relationship among factors and how they affect the number of car crashes, severity (scale from 1- 4 on its impact on traffic), and distance (length of the road extent affected)
-Create multiple predictive models for car crashes based on significant factors
-Create visualizations of these models through graphs and charts



## Conclusions
Many accidents occurred....
-In Florida and California both during the day and night (in general, majority of accidents were during the day)
-From noon to 6 PM and between October and December
-During “good weather” with high visibility (10 miles)
-Between  40℉  and 80℉
-With a severity of 2 (from a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 is the least impactful and 4 is the most)
